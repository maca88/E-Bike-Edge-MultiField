![Font padding](/Images/FontPadding.png?raw=true)

This project is used detect font paddings on various Garmin devices. Unfortunatelly the font paddings are different also between a real device and its simulator, so in case you own a device that has not been aligned yet and are willing to contribute, feel free to make a PR.

## Currently aligned Garmin devices:
- Edge 1000 (WW)
